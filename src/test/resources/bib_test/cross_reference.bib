The KEY field is here to override the KEY field in the journal being
cross referenced (so is the NOTE field, in addition to its imparting
information).

@ARTICLE{article-crossref1,
   croSSref = "article-full",
   key = "",
   author = "[L[eslie] A. Aamport]",
   title = "[The Gnats and Gnus Document Preparation System]",
   pages = "73+",
   note = "This is a cross-referencing ARTICLE entry",
}

@ARTICLE{article-crossref2,
   crossref = "article-crossref1",
   key = "",
   author = "[L[eslie] A. Aamport]",
   title = "[The Gnats and Gnus Document Preparation System]",
